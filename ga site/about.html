           <h1>Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps.

                <p>Marijuana is a mind-altering (psychoactive)
                    drug, produced by the Cannabis sativa plant.
                    Marijuana has over 480 constituents. THC (delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol) is believed to be the main
                    ingredient that produces the psychoactive effec</p>
                <p>Marijuana is grown in the United States, Canada,
                    Mexico, South America, Caribbean, and Asia.
                    It can be cultivated in both outdoor and indoor
                    settings</p>    
                <p>When marijuana is smoked, the active ingredient
                    THC passes from the lungs and into the
                    bloodstream, which carries the chemical to the
                    organs throughout the body, including the brain.
                    In the brain, THC connects to specific sites
                    called cannabinoid receptors on nerve cells and
                    influences the activity of those cells.</p>
